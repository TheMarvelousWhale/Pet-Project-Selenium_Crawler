# Selenium_Crawler
A small piece of code to crawl VN's MOF website for some info.

The program automate the folowing process:
1. Retrieve the ID from an excel file (generated by system)
2. Log into VNMOF portal 
3. Go to the specified tab, search for the entry containing that ID
4. Click on the entry
5. Navigate to new tab, click on download 
6. Retrieve and process the files

I am using Selenium for this, and there has been a lot of issues with 2 & 3 (Any help appreciated!).
The webdriver currently launch the portal, wait for user input - just so the human user can complete 2 and 3
before it can resume and automate the rest of the process. 

For 5., Selenium has an issue with not being able to close the new tab. So my current implementation is to open 20 new tabs on Chrome and then close the entire window, then run again. (Help appreciated again!)

The code is simplistic enough, but can also be optimized for multi threading (*I was trying to do this, will update in a branch)

Main takeaway:
1. Mix in human control elements via input()
2. Tab control
3. Some selenium persistent waiting instead of using normal Selenium EC as I usually do because I found it too tiring
